# testj1939-python

A reimplementation of `testj1939` using Python APIs

This is mostly intended to:

1. illustrate how to use the J1939 `socket` APIs
2. serve as a series of integration tests of the J1939 functionality

## Goals

These are various examples taken from the J1939 kickstart guide

- [x] receive without source address
- [x] receive with source address
- [ ] send
- [ ] Multiple source addresses on 1 CAN device
- [ ] Use PDU1 PGN
- [ ] Use destination address info
- [ ] Emit different PGNs using the same socket
- [ ] Larger packets

### Advanced topics with j1939

- [ ] Change priority of J1939 packets
